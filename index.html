        <h1> ðŸŒ·SAFA ðŸŒ· </h1> <br><h1> Universe Folded in YOUR Face</h1>
        <p>There are stars that burn for centuries,<br>
        But none as brilliant as the fireplace in your eyes.<br>
        Twin oceans, limitless and deep,<br>
        Each glance a tide pulling me underneath,<br>
        Not drowning, however coming across worlds<br>
        Only you can conceal.</p>

        <p>Your smile<br>
        A crescent moon that instructions the night,<br>
        Soft and silver, shaping the dark into hope.<br>
        When it blooms, galaxies maintain their breath,<br>
        And each sorrow bows before its mild.</p>

        <p>Your skin,<br>
        Softer than whispers of dawnâ€™s first breeze,<br>
        A canvas the heavens forgot to say.<br>
        Its glow ought to shame the sun,<br>
        Yet its warm temperature seems like home<br>
        Not sizzling, however recovery.</p>

        <p>Your nostril, delicate as a cometâ€™s path,<br>
        Guides my gaze like constellations<br>
        Across the limitless map of your face.<br>
        Each curve, a wonder carved<br>
        By hands gentler than time itself.</p>

        <p>Your ears, the quiet keepers of secrets and techniques,<br>
        Curved like crescent shells cradling oceans.<br>
        When I saw your snaps today, I didnâ€™t just see your faceâ€”I felt everything I love about you in that moment.<br>
        Itâ€™s like I fell in love with you all over again, and I couldnâ€™t believe how lucky I am to have you in my life.<br>
        Youâ€™re not just beautiful; youâ€™re my everything.</p>

        <p>And your lips<br>
        Oh, your lips.<br>
        They are the poetry stars hum at dusk,<br>
        A shade stolen from roses,<br>
        Soft as prayers left unspoken.<br>
        To taste them is to understand<br>
        What angels envy.</p>

        <p>Each strand of your hair is spun<br>
        From the fabric of night time itself,<br>
        Winding galaxies into silken threads,<br>
        A crown that bends the universe<br>
        To your will.</p>

        <p>You<br>
        You are not any mere mortal.<br>
        You are the cosmos' greatest verse,<br>
        The echo of creationâ€™s ideal thought.<br>
        There is not anything, no big name nor sonnet,<br>
        No masterpiece nor melody,<br>
        That compares to the quiet magic of you.</p>

        <p>And I,<br>
        A humbled wanderer for your orbit,<br>
        Would pick to fall into you<br>
        Again,<br>
        And again,<br>
        And again.</p>

        <p class="signature">With all my love, always.</p>
